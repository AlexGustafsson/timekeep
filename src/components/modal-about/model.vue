    <p>Timekeep is a simple timekeeping web app. It's intended to be easy to use.</p>
    <p>It is currently considered an alpha-level application and as such it should not be used as the sole way of tracking time.</p>
    <p>The application is currently entirely free to use and open source over at <a href="https://github.com/AlexGustafsson/timekeep">https://github.com/AlexGustafsson/timekeep</a></p>
